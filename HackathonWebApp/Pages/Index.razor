    <h2>Welcome to the Azure Festive Tech Hackathon!</h2>
    <br />
    <p>VIDEO COMES HERE</p>
    <p>This year we are hosting a hackathon and the awesome thing is that you can participate!
        The goal is to provide the opportunity to everyone to send in a submission no matter how much experience you
        have, all submissions are appreciated.
        We are not looking for just the technical deployment, we are also looking for creativity, technologies used, the
        write up and most important: <strong>that you had fun doing it!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>

        I hear you thinking <em>‚ÄúBut what do I have to build‚Äù</em> ? Well long story short: You have to automate the
        deployment of the
        solution. The deployment has to follow the requirements that Santa has provided.
    </p>

    </ol>
    <p>You can use any technology you want as long as it runs on Microsoft Azure. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your
        deployment
        is based on ARM Templates, Azure CLI, Terraform or Power Platform.
        You can use and combine any technology that you want. </p>

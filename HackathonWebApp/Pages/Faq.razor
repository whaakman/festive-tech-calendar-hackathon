    <br />
    <h4>Q: Does "customization" mean every country would get it's own code?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. Remember, Santa and his elves currently have no capacity to deal with code changes. Long story short, yes the App needs to be customized in the feature. This could imply a different app deployment in each region. However, you don't have to deal with any code changes to do that. Simple having a specific app/instance for that country will suffice</p>
        <h4>Q: Can we use Load Balancers or Azure Front Door?</h4>
    <p>Of course you can, nothing wrong that. Santa likes fancy features 😁</p>
    <h4>Q: Can I add a little personalization?</h4>
    <p>As long as you leave the code as it is you're free to do whatever you want!</p>

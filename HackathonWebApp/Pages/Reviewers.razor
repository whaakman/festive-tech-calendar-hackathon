    <p>
    Iâ€™m the CTO and one of the founders of Intercept. I live in The Netherlands, 
    am married and have three small boys. Earlier this decade we witnessed an explosive growth in the 
    private cloud sector. The Microsoft public cloud was still in it infancy. 
    However after working with several cloud solutions, we decided that Microsoftâ€™s vision of 
    freedom and flexibility to build, deploy and manage your applications anywhere was just amazing. 
    Building on top of world class technology stack and opening the doors for every vendor, 
    operating system and framework pushed Azure ahead of the pack, leading the way in cloud technology. 
    In my daily job I have the honor of working with highly skilled people, 
    of course my colleges at Intercept but also our very tech savvy software driven customers. 
    Iâ€™m learning something new every day, so go ahead and surprise me!

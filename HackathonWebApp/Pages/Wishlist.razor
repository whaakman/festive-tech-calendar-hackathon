    <h1> üéÑ Santa's App </h1>
    <br />
    <p>The code for the App can be found in <a href="https://github.com/whaakman/festive-tech-santa-wishlist"
            target="blank" class="red">this GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
    <p>Santa and his elves have created the Wishlist app for children to use and send in their requests.
        The App is build in Blazor Server and leverages a storage account to store the wish lists as a txt file. After
        publishing the App
        and storage account you need to configure the connectiong string to point the App to the storage account.
        This is done through using the App Settings on Azure App Services or environment variables if you're going for a
        Dockerfile.
        The App requires two environment variables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>connectionString</li>
        <li>storageContainerName</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The storage container with the provided name will automatically be created after submitting the wish
        list.
    </p>
    <p>Adding a present is done through providing the required items (Family Name, Name, Present, Motivation). By
        clicking <strong>"Add Present"</strong> the present will be added to the list.</p>

        Once you are happy with the list you can submit your wish list and send it to santa by click on <strong>"Send
            the list to Santa"</strong>. Wait for the message to pop up and Santa has recieved your list!</p>

    <p>
        The message will be stored in a text file in the previously provided blob container. The name of the file is
        prefixed
        by the Family Name and a random GUID is added to ensure all files are unique. Santa has yet to implement the
        backend system
        to process the wish lists. He better hurry! üòÅ

    <p>You can verify the workings of the app by opening the text file and read the contents. It should be a json string
        similar to the image below.</p>
